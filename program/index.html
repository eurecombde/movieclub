      <p>
        This is the homepage for the Eurecom Movie Club, a club for movie loving
        technologists studying at the French riviera.
      </p>

      <p>
        Want to come watch a movie? We'd love to have you with us! The schedule is to show one
        movie every week, on Fridays around 18 if not other message is given. It's only 2 euros
        to join a movie, 5 if you want to have pizza and drinks included. You are of course
        free to bring your own candy as well! All movies are shown at the Eurecom Amphi.

<p>Today it&#39;s quite common to shy far away from any movie set in a high school
environments, but there was a time when they managed to make quality content with
this theme. This is the highlight from that period.</p>
