<p>Everyone that has been on the Internet for a while will inevitabley encouter memes
sooner or later. A movie that has brough in it&#39;s faire share of those is the
comedy <strong>&laquo;Office Space&raquo;</strong> from 1999.</p>

of a heart attack, leaving Peter hypnotized.</p>

<p><strong>Robert Benigni</strong> is quite something of a man. It can be hard to play in the
movie you are directing, but Beningi is one of only two people who have directed
themselves into recieving an Oscar for Best Actor. However, he&#39;s also in the rare
company of people to have directed themselves into a Razzie for <em>Worst Actor</em>,
sharing the honors with folks like <strong>Sylvester Stallone</strong>, <strong>Kevin Costner</strong>  and
<strong>Prince</strong>, to name a few.</p>

<p>Anyway, we&#39;re focusing on <strong>&laquo;Life is Beautiful&raquo;</strong> this friday, the
movie that won him the Best Actor, along with Best Foreign Film and Best Music.
In one of the highest rated movies of all time (8.6 on
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118799/">IMDb</a>), <strong>Benigni</strong> will take us back to
Italy in the 30s, to a Jewish family trying to survive Holocaust.</p>



  <h2>
    The Man from Earth

<p><strong>Professor John Oldman</strong> (<strong>David Lee Smith</strong>) is expected to become the next
head of the anthropology department. Despite being loved by his students and
appreciated by his colleagues, he nevertheless decides to quit his job and leave.
During an unexpected farewell celebration at his home, his 10 year long friends
can&#39;t help to ask him why. The movie then begins when he then starts asking,
&quot;What if…&quot;.</p>

<p>The movie was made for only 200 000$, but it&#39;s one of the best in its domain.
Like Oldman, you&#39;ll be left wondering &quot;what if&quot;, and the thought will stay with
you long after the movie is done.</p>



  <h2>
    Master and Commander
    <small>(21-03-2014)</small>
  </h2>

<p>The name <strong>Peter Weir</strong> might not be familiar to you, but I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ve
heard of some of his movies. Does <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/">The Truman Show</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/">Dead Poets Society</a> ring a bell? Both of them (excellent!)
movies he directed before he did &laquo;<strong>Master and Commander</strong>&raquo; in 2003.</p>

<p>The movie is based on a whopping 20-volume series of novels written by <strong>Patrick
O&#39;Brian</strong>, which although fiction, are based around the actual events that took
place during the Napoleon wars. The movie is mostly inspired by the novel
&laquo;<strong>The Far Side of the World</strong>&raquo;, and follows <strong>Captain Jack Aubrey</strong>
(<strong>Russel Crowe</strong>) and ship surgeon <strong>Stephen Maturin</strong> (<strong>Paul Bettany</strong>) on
their adventures on the H.M.S Surprise as they are sent on a hunt for the French
corsair Acheron.</p>

<p>&laquo;<strong>Master and Commander</strong>&raquo; took home 2 Oscars (nominated for
8 more!), and among them Best Sound Editing, so this will also be a splendid
occasion to test the surround setup in Amphi!</p>



  <h2>
    Ferris Bueller's Day Off
    <small>(14-03-2014)</small>
  </h2>

  <p>We&#39;re kicking it off this season with the greatest high school movie from the
80s, say hello to <strong>Ferris Bueller</strong> everyone!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/9377-ferris-bueller-s-day-off">
  <img src="/images/ferris-bueller.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Today it&#39;s quite common to shy far away from any movie set in a high school
environments, but there was a time when they managed to make quality content with
this theme. This is the highlight from that period.</p>
