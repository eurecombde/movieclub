      <h1>Eurecom Movie Club</h1>

      <p>
        This is the homepage for the Eurecom Movie Club, a club for movie loving
        technologists studying at the French riviera.
      </p>

      <p>
        Want to come watch a movie? We'd love to have you with us! The schedule is to show one
        movie every week, on Fridays around 18 if not other message is given. It's only 2 euros
        to join a movie, 5 if you want to have pizza and drinks included. You are of course
        free to bring your own candy as well! All movies are shown at the Eurecom Amphi.

  <p>Why do we watch this?</p>



  <h2>
    Master and Commander
    <small>(21-03-2014)</small>
  </h2>

<p>The name Peter Weir might not be familiar to you, but I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ve
heard of some of his movies. Does <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/">The Truman Show</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/">Dead Poets Society</a> ring a bell? Both of them (excellent!)
movies he directed before he did &laquo;<strong>Master and Commander</strong>&raquo; in 2003.</p>

<p>The movie is based on a whopping 20-volume series of novels written by <strong>Patrick
O&#39;Brian</strong>, which although fiction, are based around the actual events that took
place during the Napoleon wars. The movie is mostly inspired by the novel
&laquo;<strong>The Far Side of the World</strong>&raquo;, and follows <strong>Captain Jack Aubrey</strong>
(<strong>Russel Crowe</strong>) and ship surgeon <strong>Stephen Maturin</strong> (<strong>Paul Bettany</strong>) on
their adventures on the H.M.S Surprise as they are sent on a hunt for the French
corsair Acheron.</p>

<p>&laquo;<strong>Master and Commander</strong>&raquo; took home 2 Oscars (nominated for
8 more!), and among them Best Sound Editing, so this will also be a splendid
occasion to test the surround setup in Amphi!</p>



  <h2>
    Ferris Bueller's Day Off
    <small>(14-03-2014)</small>
  </h2>

  <p>We&#39;re kicking it off this season with the greatest high school movie from the
80s, say hello to Ferris Bueller everyone!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/9377-ferris-bueller-s-day-off">
  <img src="/images/ferris-bueller.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Today it&#39;s quite common to shy far away from any movie set in a high school
environments, but there was a time when they managed to make quality content with
this theme. This is the highlight from that period.</p>
