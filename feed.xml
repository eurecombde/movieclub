        <title>Cinema Ã  la Plage</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../images/cinema-a-la-plage.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to a collision with the Cannes Film Festival this week, there will be no screening in Amphi,
but most of the regulars will be at the beach in Cannes to watch &lt;strong&gt;For a Few Dollars More&lt;/strong&gt;, a
classic spaghetti western by &lt;strong&gt;Sergio Leone&lt;/strong&gt;. Feel free to join us, it&amp;#39;s free!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie starts at 21:30, we plan to show up anywhere between 17:00 and 20:00, the earlier
the better seats, they&amp;#39;re distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of planning happens in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/241499366057786/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular&quot;&gt;Facebook group&lt;/a&gt;, drop by if you&amp;#39;re interested. You can find the
rest of the program for the festival &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/festival/aroundTheSelection/2014/CinemaPlage2014.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the screenings include &lt;strong&gt;The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Purple Rain&lt;/strong&gt;, so there&amp;#39;s lots to look forward to if you got
the evenings off the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pause</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There will be no movie this Friday due to most students leaving for the promotrip (and the others having vacation). If you&amp;#39;re going to the promotrip, you might still catch a couple of movies, as we&amp;#39;ll try to provide some lighthearted entertainment (and one braintwister), if the bus&amp;#39; entertainment system cooperates. Friday sessions will resume with &lt;strong&gt;Tucker and Dale vs Evil&lt;/strong&gt; the 9th of May. See you then!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>It's on!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The cinema season has now officially started, the movie club has shown it&amp;#39;s first movie of the
season (ever?), and more are in the planning. The board will get together to hammer out the program
for the season, or maybe only on a month-by-month basis, this remains to be seen. If you have any
suggestions to movies, we want to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little note about what we want to be. The movie club is intended to expose people to good movies
they wouldn&amp;#39;t normally come across. We do not intend to compete with cinemas and show mainstream
stuff, we&amp;#39;re looking for the gems that slip under the huge media radar, or older stuff that &amp;quot;kids&amp;quot;
these days haven&amp;#39;t heard of. The intention is that regular participation in the movie club will
be part of your cultural education, exposing you to classics, must-sees from a couple of decades
back, and also try to provide some context for each movie; why are we watching this? Is it because
of the surroundings of it&amp;#39;s creation? Was it, like &amp;laquo;&lt;strong&gt;Blair Witch Project&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;raquo; or
&amp;laquo;&lt;strong&gt;Primer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;raquo;, made on a really small budget? Did it capture the theme of the period it
was made? Is it a lesser known brain child of a director famous for other things? We want to give
you a couple of these hooks to put each movie on, maybe some funny trivia or backstories you
haven&amp;#39;t heard, a little extra layer in addition to just watching movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds interesting? Cool! Come drop by next Friday, we&amp;#39;ll be screening the naval action drama
&amp;laquo;&lt;strong&gt;Master and Commander&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;raquo; from 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
