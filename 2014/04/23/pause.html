        This is the homepage for the Eurecom Movie Club, a club for movie loving
        technologists studying at the French riviera.

      <p>
        Want to come watch a movie? We'd love to have you with us! The schedule is to show one
        movie every week, on Fridays around 17:30 if no other message is given. It's free to join,
        but we wont provide you with candy - bring your own! All movies are shown at the Eurecom
        Amphi.

<article>

  <p>There will be no movie this Friday due to most students leaving for the promotrip (and the others having vacation). If you&#39;re going to the promotrip, you might still catch a couple of movies, as we&#39;ll try to provide some lighthearted entertainment (and one braintwister), if the bus&#39; entertainment system cooperates. Friday sessions will resume with <strong>Tucker and Dale vs Evil</strong> the 9th of May. See you then!</p>
