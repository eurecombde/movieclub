      <h1>Eurecom Movie Club</h1>

      <p>
        This is the homepage for the Eurecom Movie Club, a club for movie loving
        technologists studying at the French riviera.
      </p>

      <p>
        Want to come watch a movie? We'd love to have you with us! The schedule is to show one
        movie every week, on Fridays around 18 if not other message is given. It's only 2 euros
        to join a movie, 5 if you want to have pizza and drinks included. You are of course
        free to bring your own candy as well! All movies are shown at the Eurecom Amphi.

  <p>The cinema season has now officially started, the movie club has shown it&#39;s first movie of the
season (ever?), and more are in the planning. The board will get together to hammer out the program
for the season, or maybe only on a month-by-month basis, this remains to be seen. If you have any
suggestions to movies, we want to here from you!</p>

<p>A little note about what we want to be. The movie club is intended to expose people to good movies
they wouldn&#39;t normally come across. We do not intend to compete with cinemas and show mainstream
stuff, we&#39;re looking for the gems that slip under the huge media radar, or older stuff that &quot;kids&quot;
these days haven&#39;t heard of. The intention is that regular participation in the movie club will
be part of your cultural education, exposing you to classics, must-sees from a couple of decades
back, and also try to provide some context for each movie; why are we watching this? Is it because
of the surroundings of it&#39;s creation? Was it, like &laquo;<strong>Blair Witch Project</strong>&raquo; or
&laquo;<strong>Primer</strong>&raquo;, made on a really small budget? Did it capture the theme of the period it
was made? Is it a lesser known brain child of a director famous for other things? We want to give
you a couple of these hooks to put each movie on, maybe some funny trivia or backstories you
haven&#39;t heard, a little extra layer in addition to just watching movies.</p>

<p>Sounds interesting? Cool! Come drop by next Friday, we&#39;ll be screening the naval action drama
&laquo;<strong>Master and Commander</strong>&raquo; from 2007.</p>
