      <p>
        This is the homepage for the Eurecom Movie Club, a club for movie loving
        technologists studying at the French riviera.
      </p>

      <p>
        Want to come watch a movie? We'd love to have you with us! The schedule is to show one
        movie every week, on Fridays around 17:30 if no other message is given. It's free to join,
        but we wont provide you with candy - bring your own! All movies are shown at the Eurecom
        Amphi.

<p>Due to a collision with the Cannes Film Festival this week, there will be no screening in Amphi,
but most of the regulars will be at the beach in Cannes to watch <strong>For a Few Dollars More</strong>, a
classic spaghetti western by <strong>Sergio Leone</strong>. Feel free to join us, it&#39;s free!</p>

<p>The movie starts at 21:30, we plan to show up anywhere between 17:00 and 20:00, the earlier
the better seats, they&#39;re distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>

<p>Most of planning happens in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/241499366057786/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular">Facebook group</a>, drop by if you&#39;re interested. You can find the
rest of the program for the festival <a href="http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/festival/aroundTheSelection/2014/CinemaPlage2014.html">here</a>. The rest of the screenings include <strong>The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly</strong>, <strong>Pulp Fiction</strong> and <strong>Purple Rain</strong>, so there&#39;s lots to look forward to if you got
the evenings off the coming weeks.</p>
