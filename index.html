      <h1>Eurecom Movie Club</h1>

      <p>
        This is the homepage for the Eurecom Movie Club, a club for movie loving
        technologists studying at the French riviera.
      </p>

      <p>
        Want to come watch a movie? We'd love to have you with us! The schedule is to show one
        movie every week, on Fridays around 18 if not other message is given. It's only 2 euros
        to join a movie, 5 if you want to have pizza and drinks included. You are of course
        free to bring your own candy as well! All movies are shown at the Eurecom Amphi.

        Ferris Bueller's Day Off

      </h2>

      <p>
        We're kicking it off this season with the greatest high school movie from the 80s, say
        hello to Ferris Bueller everyone!

      <p>
        Today it's quite common to shy far away from any movie set in a high school environments,
        but there was a time when they managed to make quality content with this theme. This is the
        highlight from that period.
