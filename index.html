      <h1>Eurecom Movie Club</h1>

      <p>
        This is the homepage for the Eurecom Movie Club, a club for movie loving
        technologists studying at the French riviera.
      </p>

      <p>
        Want to come watch a movie? We'd love to have you with us! The schedule is to show one
        movie every week, on Fridays around 17:30 if no other message is given. It's free to join,
        but we wont provide you with candy - bring your own! All movies are shown at the Eurecom
        Amphi.

    <h2>Cinema à la Plage</h2>

    <p><img src="../../images/cinema-a-la-plage.jpg"></p>

<p>Due to a collision with the Cannes Film Festival this week, there will be no screening in Amphi,
but most of the regulars will be at the beach in Cannes to watch <strong>For a Few Dollars More</strong>, a
classic spaghetti western by <strong>Sergio Leone</strong>. Feel free to join us, it&#39;s free!</p>

<p>The movie starts at 21:30, we plan to show up anywhere between 17:00 and 20:00, the earlier
the better seats, they&#39;re distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>

<p>Most of planning happens in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/241499366057786/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular">Facebook group</a>, drop by if you&#39;re interested. You can find the
rest of the program for the festival <a href="http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/festival/aroundTheSelection/2014/CinemaPlage2014.html">here</a>. The rest of the screenings include <strong>The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly</strong>, <strong>Pulp Fiction</strong> and <strong>Purple Rain</strong>, so there&#39;s lots to look forward to if you got
the evenings off the coming weeks.</p>

    <h2>Pause</h2>

    <p>There will be no movie this Friday due to most students leaving for the promotrip (and the others having vacation). If you&#39;re going to the promotrip, you might still catch a couple of movies, as we&#39;ll try to provide some lighthearted entertainment (and one braintwister), if the bus&#39; entertainment system cooperates. Friday sessions will resume with <strong>Tucker and Dale vs Evil</strong> the 9th of May. See you then!</p>

    <h2>It's on!</h2>

    <p>The cinema season has now officially started, the movie club has shown it&#39;s first movie of the
season (ever?), and more are in the planning. The board will get together to hammer out the program
for the season, or maybe only on a month-by-month basis, this remains to be seen. If you have any
suggestions to movies, we want to hear from you!</p>

<p>A little note about what we want to be. The movie club is intended to expose people to good movies
they wouldn&#39;t normally come across. We do not intend to compete with cinemas and show mainstream
stuff, we&#39;re looking for the gems that slip under the huge media radar, or older stuff that &quot;kids&quot;
these days haven&#39;t heard of. The intention is that regular participation in the movie club will
be part of your cultural education, exposing you to classics, must-sees from a couple of decades
back, and also try to provide some context for each movie; why are we watching this? Is it because
of the surroundings of it&#39;s creation? Was it, like &laquo;<strong>Blair Witch Project</strong>&raquo; or
&laquo;<strong>Primer</strong>&raquo;, made on a really small budget? Did it capture the theme of the period it
was made? Is it a lesser known brain child of a director famous for other things? We want to give
you a couple of these hooks to put each movie on, maybe some funny trivia or backstories you
haven&#39;t heard, a little extra layer in addition to just watching movies.</p>

<p>Sounds interesting? Cool! Come drop by next Friday, we&#39;ll be screening the naval action drama
&laquo;<strong>Master and Commander</strong>&raquo; from 2007.</p>
