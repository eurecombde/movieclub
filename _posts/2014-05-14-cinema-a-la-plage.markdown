Due to a collision with the Cannes Film Festival this week, there will be no screening in Amphi,
but most of the regulars will be at the beach in Cannes to watch **For a Few Dollars More**, a
classic spaghetti western by **Sergio Leone**. Feel free to join us, it's free!

The movie starts at 21:30, we plan to show up anywhere between 17:00 and 20:00, the earlier
the better seats, they're distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis.

Most of planning happens in the [Facebook group], drop by if you're interested. You can find the
rest of the program for the festival [here]. The rest of the screenings include **The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly**, **Pulp Fiction** and **Purple Rain**, so there's lots to look forward to if you got
the evenings off the coming weeks.
