There will be no movie this Friday due to most students leaving for the promotrip (and the others having vacation). If you're going to the promotrip, you might still catch a couple of movies, as we'll try to provide some lighthearted entertainment (and one braintwister), if the bus' entertainment system cooperates. Friday sessions will resume with **Tucker and Dale vs Evil** the 9th of May. See you then!
