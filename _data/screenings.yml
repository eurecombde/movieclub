                  The name Peter Weir might not be familiar to you, but I'm pretty sure you've
                  heard of some of his movies. Does [The Truman Show]
                  (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/) or [Dead Poets Society]
                  (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/) ring a bell? Both of them (excellent!)
                  movies he directed before he did &laquo;**Master and Commander**&raquo; in 2003.

                  The movie is based on a whopping 20-volume series of novels written by **Patrick
                  O'Brian**, which although fiction, are based around the actual events that took
                  place during the Napoleon wars. The movie is mostly inspired by the novel
                  &laquo;**The Far Side of the World**&raquo;, and follows **Captain Jack Aubrey**
                  (**Russel Crowe**) and ship surgeon **Stephen Maturin** (**Paul Bettany**) on
                  their adventures on the H.M.S Surprise as they are sent on a hunt for the French
                  corsair Acheron.

                  &laquo;**Master and Commander**&raquo; took home 2 Oscars (nominated for
                  8 more!), and among them Best Sound Editing, so this will also be a splendid
                  occasion to test the surround setup in Amphi!

                  We're kicking it off this season with the greatest high school movie from the
                  80s, say hello to Ferris Bueller everyone!

                  Today it's quite common to shy far away from any movie set in a high school
                  environments, but there was a time when they managed to make quality content with
                  this theme. This is the highlight from that period.
