                  We're kicking it off this season with the greatest high school movie from the
                  80s, say hello to Ferris Bueller everyone!

                  Today it's quite common to shy far away from any movie set in a high school
                  environments, but there was a time when they managed to make quality content with
                  this theme. This is the highlight from that period.
