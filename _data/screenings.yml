                  Nine years after the masterpiece **&laquo;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
                  Nest&raquo;** from 1975, director **Miloš Forman** is back. Telling the story of
                  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, **Amadeus** collected a nice 8 Oscars back in 1984. Join
                  us for an exhibition on the genius, the music, and the insanity of one of the
                  greatest classical composers the world has ever seen.

                  **Robert Benigni** is quite something of a man. It can be hard to play in the
                  movie you are directing, but Beningi is one of only two people who have directed
                  themselves into recieving an Oscar for Best Actor. However, he's also in the rare
                  company of people to have directed themselves into a Razzie for *Worst Actor*,
                  sharing the honors with folks like **Sylvester Stallone**, **Kevin Costner**  and
                  **Prince**, to name a few.

                  Anyway, we're focusing on **&laquo;Life is Beautiful&raquo;** this friday, the
                  movie that won him the Best Actor, along with Best Foreign Film and Best Music.
                  In one of the highest rated movies of all time (8.6 on
                  [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118799/)), **Benigni** will take us back to
                  Italy in the 30s, to a Jewish family trying to survive Holocaust.


- title: The Man from Earth

                  </a>

                  **Professor John Oldman** (**David Lee Smith**) is expected to become the next
                  head of the anthropology department. Despite being loved by his students and
                  appreciated by his colleagues, he nevertheless decides to quit his job and leave.
                  During an unexpected farewell celebration at his home, his 10 year long friends
                  can't help to ask him why. The movie then begins when he then starts asking,
                  "What if…".

                  The movie was made for only 200 000$, but it's one of the best in its domain.
                  Like Oldman, you'll be left wondering "what if", and the thought will stay with
                  you long after the movie is done.


- title: Master and Commander

                  </a>

                  The name **Peter Weir** might not be familiar to you, but I'm pretty sure you've
                  heard of some of his movies. Does [The Truman Show]
                  (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/) or [Dead Poets Society]
                  (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/) ring a bell? Both of them (excellent!)
                  movies he directed before he did &laquo;**Master and Commander**&raquo; in 2003.

                  The movie is based on a whopping 20-volume series of novels written by **Patrick
                  O'Brian**, which although fiction, are based around the actual events that took
                  place during the Napoleon wars. The movie is mostly inspired by the novel
                  &laquo;**The Far Side of the World**&raquo;, and follows **Captain Jack Aubrey**
                  (**Russel Crowe**) and ship surgeon **Stephen Maturin** (**Paul Bettany**) on
                  their adventures on the H.M.S Surprise as they are sent on a hunt for the French
                  corsair Acheron.

                  &laquo;**Master and Commander**&raquo; took home 2 Oscars (nominated for
                  8 more!), and among them Best Sound Editing, so this will also be a splendid
                  occasion to test the surround setup in Amphi!


- title: Ferris Bueller's Day Off

                  We're kicking it off this season with the greatest high school movie from the
                  80s, say hello to **Ferris Bueller** everyone!

                  <a href="http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/9377-ferris-bueller-s-day-off">

                  </a>

                  Today it's quite common to shy far away from any movie set in a high school
                  environments, but there was a time when they managed to make quality content with
                  this theme. This is the highlight from that period.
